# Executive Dashboard (Tableau Project)

This repository contains my **Tableau Executive Dashboard project**, created as part of the **Maven Analytics Tableau Course**. The project focuses on designing an executive-level dashboard that translates business data into clear, interactive insights for decision-makers.  

## üìä Project Overview  
This project is part of a **hands-on, project-based Tableau course** designed to teach how to connect, analyze, and visualize data through real-world case studies.  

In this project, I took on the role of a newly hired **Data Analyst at Maven Supplies**, a modern office supply company aiming to boost its performance insights through data visualization. My mission was to design and deliver an **executive-level business intelligence (BI) dashboard** in Tableau that captures key business metrics such as **sales, profit, quantity, and discounts**.

## üéØ Objective  
To create an interactive **Executive Dashboard** that empowers company leaders to make data-driven decisions by:  
- Tracking **Year-to-Date (YTD)** performance across Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Discounts

- Analyzing **Sales and Profit by Segment, Sub-Category, and City**  
- Monitoring **monthly sales and profit trends**  
- Filtering and exploring data across **multiple dimensions** (Date, Category, Segment, Region, State, and City)

1. **Connecting and transforming the dataset** to prepare it for analysis  
2. Exploring **sorting, filtering, and grouping tools** to organize data effectively  
3. Building and formatting a variety of **visuals and charts** for business insights  
4. Defining **custom calculations and parameters** to enhance dashboard interactivity
